## Demo

![logseq gpt3 openai demo](docs/demo.gif)

## Usage
### `gpt-block`

Type `/gpt-block` in a block or select `gpt-block` from the block menu.

`gpt-block` will send the block to OpenAI's GPT-3 API and append the response underneath the block.

![logseq gpt-block](docs/gpt-block.gif)

### `gpt-page`
Type `/gpt-page` in a block or select `gpt-page` from the block menu.

`gpt-page` will send the entire page to OpenAI's GPT-3 API and append the response to the bottom of the page.

![logseq gpt-page](docs/gpt-page.gif)

### `dalle`
Type `/dalle` in a block or select `dalle` from the block menu.

This will generate an image using the DALL-E model, save the image to the `assets` folder, and insert the image into the block.

![logseq dalle](docs/dalle.gif)

### Inject Prefix
Allows you to inject a prefix into the GPT-3 output before it is inserted into the block, such as a [[gpt3]] tag or markdown formatting like `>` for a blockquote. This is useful for identifying blocks that were generated by GPT-3.
Use the `Inject Prefix` options in the setting to set the prefix. You can add a space or `\n` newline to separate the prefix from the generated text.

## About <a name = "about"></a>

`logseq-plugin-gpt3-openai` allows users to generate human-like text using GPT-3 within the LogSeq editor.

Write a GPT-3 command in a block, then run the open `/gpt` command via the slash or block menu. The plugin will generate a GPT-3 response using the OpenAI API and insert it below. It removes leading and trailing whitespace from the prompt.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

- You need to [get an OpenAI API Key here](https://openai.com/api/) and add the key in the plugin settings.

- Make sure you [read OpenAI's usage guidelines](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines) and avoid generating certain types of content.

- Download the plugin in the Logseq marketplace by searching for `gpt3` or `openai`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

GPT-3 has limitations. It sometimes produces output that is subtly wrong or misleading. Don't rely on its output without verifying it yourself. Use it with caution.

## FAQ <a name = "faq"></a>
### What is GPT-3 and OpenAI, and how does it work?
See [this article for a good overview.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21355768/gpt-3-ai-openai-turing-test-language)

###  Errors
#### OpenAI Quota Reached

Your free trial is over, or you've run out of tokens. You can refill your tokens [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/billing/overview).
#### `OpenAI Rate Limited`
OpenAI has limits on how often you can call them. If you get this error, you'll need to wait a bit before trying again. See this [article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5955598-is-api-usage-subject-to-any-rate-limits) for more info on the rate limits. You can call it faster if you have a paid account.

#### `Refused to set unsafe header "User Agent"`
This error doesn't cause any issues besides the error message in the console. It's a known issue with the OpenAI API. See [this issue](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/issues/6) for more details. I'm working on a PR to their library to support browser usage. Ignore this error for now.

### Debugging
![openai](docs/openai-error.png)]

- Open the developer tools (Menu -> View -> Toggle Developer tools)

- Check the console logs for error messages.

![](docs/debug.png)

![](docs/response.png)

- See if you can figure out the error on your own. Maybe you had a network issue if it says something like "timed out." Sometimes the OpenAI API has issues. You also have a limited number of tokens, so you may run out and need to refill. 

- If you can't figure it out based on the error message and it doesn't go away. Make an issue on GitHub.
